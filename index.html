      <p>This year was the 2nd Annual Emos's Not Dead Cruise, which set sail from Miami's port to Great Stirrup Cay, Bahamas. With 3,000 like-minded individuals on board, we set sail ready to dive deep into the soul-stirring melodies and angst-filled anthems that defined our emo culture. The star-studded lineup featured the likes of Yellowcard, Underoath, The Devil Wears Prada, Story of the Year, and more. From heartfelt sing-alongs to late-night jam sessions under the stars, this cruise was a celebration of everything that makes our emo hearts beat faster. </p>
